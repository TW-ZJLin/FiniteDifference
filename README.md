# FiniteDifference

Three Numerical differentiations for unkown function:
1. Forward Finite Difference
2. Central Finite Difference
3. Backward Finite Difference

NOTE:
The Central Finite Difference Method is recommended to get a smooth result.
When a larger neighbor is used, the boundary error will be larger.
