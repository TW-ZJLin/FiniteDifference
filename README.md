# FiniteDifference

Three Numerical differentiations for unkown function:
1. Forward Finite Difference
2. Central Finite Difference
3. Backward Finite Difference

NOTE: The Central Finite Difference Method is recommended. When "neighbor" becomes larger, the curve will be smoother, but the boundary error will also be larger.
